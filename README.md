Phylogenetics inference tools.

### TODOs

#### Both 

- __write down the full theoretical model__
- solve the problem with PIP
- look at the implementation of emission model 
- think about the identification issues

#### Sean

- create emission model for beta-binomial process
- edit the log-likelihood by creating a new UnrootedTreeLikelihood for copy number states
- add the custom rate matrix construction to unrootedtreelikelihood 



#### Sohrab

- look at casting into charsequence similarly to protein from Crystal? [DONE]
- adding validity check to cn pair input [DONE]


#### Notes: 

- current assumes error model homogeneity across all sites
