Phylogenetics inference tools.

### TODOs

#### Both 

- look at the implementation of emission model 
- think about the identification issues

#### Sean

- create emission model for beta-binomial process
- edit the log-likelihood by creating a new UnrootedTreeLikelihood for copy number states
- add the custom rate matrix construction to unrootedtreelikelihood 



#### Sohrab

- look at casting into charsequence similarly to protein from Crystal? 
- adding validity check to cn pair input 


#### Notes: 

- current assumes error model homogeneity across all sites
